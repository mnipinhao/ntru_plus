/*
 * NTRU+1152 fixed-size hash transcripts.
 *
 * SHAKE256(0x00 || pk[1728]) -> 32 and SHAKE256(0x01 || msg[1728]) -> 288, both
 * through the portable prefixed sponge.  Assembly is reserved for the Keccak
 * permutation itself, which is the arrangement mldsa-native and mlkem-native
 * use: their Keccak API is permute(state*) and every sponge is portable C over
 * an opaque state.
 *
 * The hand-written fused kernels this file used to call are gone.  They kept
 * the state live in registers across a whole hash, which is worth about 2% of
 * hash_f and hash_g when both sides use the same assembly permutation, but they
 * need one kernel per (parameter set, domain, backend), they bake the block
 * counts into the dispatch so a size change is silently wrong rather than a
 * compile error, and unlike the permutations they cannot follow upstream.
