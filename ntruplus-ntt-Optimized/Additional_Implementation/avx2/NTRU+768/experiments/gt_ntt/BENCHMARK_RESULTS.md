# AVX2 GT prototype benchmark results

## 2026-07-15 Ryzen 7 9700X preliminary run

This run compares the verified intrinsic GT forward transform with the hybrid
stage-3+4+5 ASM SoA prototype and the existing production AVX2 implementation.
It is a development measurement, not a release claim.

Environment:

- CPU: AMD Ryzen 7 9700X, family 26 model 68, microcode `0xb40401c`.
- OS: Fedora, Linux `7.1.0-0.rc1.260501g26fd6bff2c050.13.fc45.x86_64`.
- Compiler: GCC 16.1.1 20260703.
- Flags: `-march=x86-64-v3 -mtune=znver5 -mprefer-vector-width=256`.
- Pinned CPU: 2; SMT sibling: 10.
- Governor: `performance`; frequency boost: enabled.
- Harness: 64 rotating input sets, 100 warmups, 1000 calls/sample,
  101 TSC samples, and 100000 calls/perf measurement.
- Timestamp: `20260715T050453Z`.

Correctness gates passed before measurement: production NTRU+768 KEM test,
GT boundary/differential/layout tests, benchmark NTT round-trip and schoolbook
polynomial multiplication validation, and AVX2 linked-binary audit.

### Forward NTT comparison

The TSC values are serialized invariant-TSC ticks per call.  Hardware cycles
and instructions are `perf stat` counts divided by 100000 calls.

| Implementation | TSC median | p10 | p90 | p99 | Hardware cycles/call | Instructions/call |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Production AVX2 `ntt` | 444 | 441 | 448 | 454 | 663.44 | 2333.29 |
| GT intrinsic `gt-ntt` | 1476 | 1457 | 1483 | 1488 | 2146.75 | 9345.29 |
| GT hybrid ASM SoA | 983 | 980 | 989 | 1003 | 1451.39 | 6062.01 |

Relative to the GT intrinsic baseline, the hybrid ASM lowers median TSC ticks
by 33.4%, hardware cycles by 32.4%, and retired instructions by 35.1%.
It is still 2.21x the production forward NTT median, so the remaining intrinsic
frontend/stage-1+2 and the different GT decomposition are now the main work,
not evidence that this prototype should replace production.

### Existing production pipeline context

| Operation | TSC median | p10 | p90 | p99 |
| --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Production basemul | 319 | 316 | 320 | 329 |
| Production inverse NTT | 436 | 434 | 442 | 447 |
| Production full polynomial multiplication | 1656 | 1646 | 1664 | 1676 |

There is no GT SoA basemul, inverse NTT, or full-polymul number yet.  The new
forward output cannot be fed into the existing production kernels without a
layout conversion, and adding a standalone conversion would defeat the chosen
fused-layout design.

### Measurement limitations

- Boost was enabled, so invariant-TSC ticks and unhalted hardware cycles differ.
- The process was pinned to CPU 2, but sibling CPU 10 was not reserved or
  disabled.
- This result should be repeated with boost controlled and both SMT siblings
  isolated before making promotion or microarchitecture claims.
